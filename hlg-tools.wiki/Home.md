# Introduction

Welcome to the **hlg-tools** wiki! This is where documentation and tutorials are kept for the project. You can also find a collection of **pq2hlg** commands in the [Movies Database](./Movies-Database).

# Tools

These are the main parts of the **hlg-tools** suite. Most of them generate 3D LUTs that perform some type of conversion.

* [**pq2hlg**](./pq2hlg) - LUT generator for converting PQ (typically HDR10) into HLG
* [**hlg2pq**](./hlg2pq) - LUT generator for converting HLG into PQ (typically HDR10)
* **mono709** - LUT generator for grayscaling BT.709 SDR
* **pqstat** - Accepts a raw 10-bit PQ stream and outputs basic statistics

# Movies Database

The [Movies Database](./Movies-Database) wiki page contains reasonable **pq2hlg** commands for movies I have personally converted to HLG.
