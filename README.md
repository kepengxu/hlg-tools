This tool suite consists of the basics needed to generate 3D LUTs that will convert video
streams from Perceptual Quantizer (PQ) HDR into Hybrid-Log Gamma (HLG) HDR. This is intended
to facilitate individuals in converting their physical HDR10 video libraries into HLG, thereby
allowing more universal viewing on devices including SDR displays.

Most of the work here is based on ITU-R BT.2408.

Note that nothing here addresses the topic of decrypting physical media.

**Please see the project's wiki for documentation.**
